Description:

Data Science has been ranked as one of the hottest professions and the demand for data practitioners is booming. This Professional Certificate from IBM is intended for anyone interested in developing skills and experience to pursue a career in Data Science or Machine Learning.

This Certification program consists of 9 courses providing you with latest job-ready skills and techniques covering a wide array of data science topics as follows:

1.	What is Data Science?
2.	Tools for Data Science
3.	Data Science Methodology
4.	Python for Data Science and AI
5.	Databases and SQL for Data Science
6.	Data Analysis with Python
7.	Data Visualization with Python
8.	Machine Learning with Python
9.	Applied Data Science Capstone

It is a myth that to become a data scientist you need a Ph.D. This Professional Certificate is suitable for anyone who has some computer skills and a passion for self-learning. No prior computer science or programming knowledge is necessary. We start small, re-enforce applied learning, and build up to more complex topics.
Upon successfully completing these courses we will complete several hands-on assignments and built a portfolio of data science projects to provide with the confidence to plunge into an exciting profession in Data Science. In addition to earning a Professional Certificate from Coursera, we will also receive a digital Badge from IBM recognizing your proficiency in Data Science.
